# OSWM - OpenSidewalkMap

OpensSidewalkMap is a fully GitHub-hosted and maintained Open-Source project. Its objective is to provide a set of tools for pedestrian-network data management, using OpenStreetMap data and open tools. The project is modular and decentered.

This repo contains the Map to access the instances (or "Nodes") of OSWM (that shall be created for each city, like in https://github.com/kauevestena/opensidewalkmap_beta ). Each instance got the same modules, enabling a rich set of local analyses. 

The instances are indexed at: https://github.com/kauevestena/opensidewalkmap/blob/main/data/cities_data.csv

The codebase for all the nodes is at: https://github.com/kauevestena/oswm_codebase 

The one-repo-per-city idea was based on the amazing Equal Gender Names project ( https://equalstreetnames.org/ )

More instructions on how to deploy an instance of OpenSidewalkMap are coming soon!
